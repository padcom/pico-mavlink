# pico-mavlink

Native MAVLink 1 and 2 for [Pico](https://github.com/padcom/pico-lang), modelled on
[node-mavlink](https://github.com/ArduPilot/node-mavlink) and
[mavlink-mappings](https://github.com/ArduPilot/node-mavlink-mappings).

Status: **in development (MV1).**
- **Done:** the byte layer, the generated `minimal`, `standard`, `common` and `ardupilotmega`
  dialects (checked against mavlink-mappings), and a framing spike that splits node-mavlink's
  3412-packet capture exactly as node-mavlink does.
- **Next:** the splitter, parser, protocols and signing.

The design is in [docs/design.md](docs/design.md).

## Development

```sh
(cd generator && npm install) && (cd oracle && npm install)
scripts/check.sh            # regenerate + diff, oracle, fmt/lint, tests
```

The generator reads the MAVLink XML from a `mavlink-mappings` checkout (`MAPPINGS=…`, default
`../../mavlink-mappings`). The XML isn't part of this repository.

## License

MIT. The generated dialects are MAVLink generator output, which is MIT under the mavlink/mavlink exception.
